# Powerball-2020
LOTTERY.py This algorithm is meant to suggest lottery numbers to be played for the POWERBALL game. POWERBALL has 69 balls that are drawn 5 at a time per play as of 10/07/2015. (There is a an extra ball–the "power ball"–between numbers 1 to 26, but we don't consider those in our probabilities; however, the power balls are noted for historical drawings. You will also see that the multiplier is included as unused data in the powerball.txt file.) The powerball.txt file is a list of historical drawings. The tickets.txt file is a list of played numbers. Edits to this existing project will include: UX design hints and ease of access, current census data to exclude most recent birthdates in guessing, powerball generator, etc.  Doc Kellogg began this project on March 30th, 2020 with expectations to commit to master file by April 13th, 2020 @ 11:30pm  © 2020 GitHub, Inc.
